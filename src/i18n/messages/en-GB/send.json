Here is an example: if the response shows you are is_blacklist: true or status: \"hold\", it means the account is under risk control review, and withdrawals or distributions may be suspended. If this function is unavailable during the test operation period, please submit an appeal through the customer service bot and provide the transaction hash, and we will expedite processing based on on-chain evidence."

Users need to obtain the passphrase at the specified location to claim the red packet after entering it.",

      "3": "In the API settings interface, we first need to inform the API of the conditions, referred to as 'condition declaration' (excluding user_id). Example: Return a set of threshold conditions, such as level, status, whether on the blacklist, etc. moonpacket will regard this set of conditions as the basic threshold.",
      "4": "Next, when the user wants to receive a red packet, the API needs to provide: 'User Query' (including user_id). Example: Return the actual value of that user. The platform will compare the results of 'User Query' with the previously set 'condition declaration' threshold; if it matches, it is approved; if not, it is rejected.",
      "5": "Safety Recommendation: Please only provide read-only endpoints and enable api_key along with domain whitelisting restrictions; if cross-domain operations are needed, you can use Cloudflare Workers as a relay and implement rate limiting.",
      "6": "Can the activity rules be modified midway?",
      "7": "No modifications can be made midway. We hope all users of this system can mutually maintain trust. If a project party promises to issue red packets but changes the game qualifications midway, making it impossible to claim, this will damage players' trust. If the issuer modifies the API to change rules, and multiple players report it, we will retain the right to suspend or freeze accounts upon confirming through change logs. Therefore, please absolutely avoid changing game rules mid-API, as it may lead to account bans.",
      "8": "If you are worried about incorrect settings, the correct approach is:",
      "9": "You can first create your own test group, issue test red packets to yourself in the test group, and once confirmed without issues, proceed to distribute in the official community. The basic rule for red packets is: you cannot call for a stop midway, nor can you directly change rules for an ongoing activity. Each round must be completed and settled according to the original commitment before new rules can be used in the next round."

      "2": "It's advisable not to execute too many activities simultaneously in the same group to avoid conflicts. Users may also get confused; it's best to execute activities linearly, one at a time or one per day, and ensure adequate funds to complete each activity.",

To ensure the fairness of the system, we will specifically block users attempting to use bots to grab red packets. The best prevention method is to allow users to set their own API and conditions and restrict the number of claims, which will raise the threshold for those who like to cheat.
