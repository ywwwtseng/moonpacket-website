      "The operation process is as follows: after the initiator recharges assets to the designated moonpacket address, the equivalent amount will be marked as 'assets available for distribution in this activity' in Off-chain records; during the activity period, the system will only mark or split amounts in Off-chain without guaranteeing immediate, individual, transactional direct on-chain transfers to any single individual's wallet; only when qualified participants redeem and pass technical and compliance reviews will moonpacket trigger actual on-chain transfers.",
