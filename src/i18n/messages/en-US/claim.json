    "q1_title": "1) Start with eligibility",
    "q1_body": [
      "How to register? Activate our bot to automatically complete basic registration. moonpacket allows group owners to add the red packet bot to their groups, and players can participate not only in the official group but also in any group with the moonpacket red packet bot.",
      "What do I need to install or disable? No additional app installation is required; we recommend using the latest version of Telegram. If opening the mini app/WebApp through the system browser, please ensure that cookies or storage are not blocked to avoid issues with login and records.",
      "Who can participate? Generally, all Telegram users can participate. However, rules may vary for each group or activity, and specific conditions may be required (e.g., role, invitation eligibility, location, task completion, etc.). Please refer to the group owner's or activity organizer's red packet instructions for details.",
      "Can I redeem multiple times using different accounts or devices? Most group admins prohibit abuse. The system will reduce the likelihood of a single person redeeming more than once through methods such as Telegram account, verification code, linked email, unique wallet address, and reducing moonini reward weight.",
      "Tip: When you receive a red packet, remember to thank the group admin. You can also like and support their community channels or social media."
    ],
    "q2_title": "2) Event rules and fairness",
    "q2_body": [
      "Is the red packet random or evenly distributed? The distribution mode of the red packet is set by the group owner or event organizer and may be 'random', 'even distribution', or 'designated'. Rules may vary between different groups, so please refer to the event description of that group.",
      "How to ensure fairness? moonpacket only provides tools for red packet distribution and verification. The platform itself is not an investor or a promised return entity and does not intervene in the business arrangements of group owners or event organizers. Our system handles the distribution process based on public rules and consistent algorithms to avoid intentional bias.",
      "How many times can I receive it? Determined by the event organizer. Some events only allow once, some have daily limits, and others allow multiple people to receive multiple times, but with a cap. Once the cap is reached, the system will automatically block and notify you.",
      "Will the event end early or be extended? It may happen. If the red packet shares have been exhausted, the expiration time has arrived, or the organizer suspends the event due to risks or abnormal behavior, the event will end or be halted. The red packet page will be updated as soon as possible, but there may be delays in synchronization across groups or platforms. If you click and see that you cannot receive it, please refresh the page to confirm the latest status."
    ],
    "q3_title": "3) Claim Process and Task",
    "q3_body": [
      "Why can't I receive it after clicking? Common reasons include: the quota has been exhausted, you have not completed the task, or the event has been suspended due to risk control. Due to potential delays in status synchronization between different groups, it may not be reflected immediately, so please refer to the latest announcement within the group.",
      "What is task unlocking? Some red packets require you to complete specific conditions (such as joining a group, following a channel, entering a password, or completing external tasks) before you can receive it. After completion, please return to the button on the same red packet message and click 'Receive Red Packet' again.",
      "I clearly completed the task, why does it show as not passed? The Telegram API may have synchronization delays in different contexts. If you just finished but the system hasn't recognized it yet, please wait a moment and try again. If it's still not passed after a long time, there may be an issue with the event organizer's API; please report directly to the organizer or group admin of the red packet.",
      "Where can I obtain the passphrase? If the event has set a passphrase, it is usually announced by the organizer through announcements, posts, live broadcasts, or videos. If you encounter an error when entering the passphrase, you can try again; multiple errors may trigger rate limits or temporary locks.",
      "How is verification for external tasks (like website registration or trading) done? Some organizers will check whether you have completed the specified tasks via an API connection with moonpacket. When you click 'Claim', the system will immediately ask that API and return the verification result. If it hasn't successfully returned, please try to trigger it again later."
    ],
    "q4_title": "4) Amount, balance, and withdrawal",
    "q4_body": [
      "Where can I check the amount I claimed? After a successful claim, the Telegram bot will push notifications, and you can check the claiming records, history, and withdrawable balance in the mini app or WebApp.",
      "Which assets are supported? It depends on the event settings; currently, the common ones are USDT, SOL, ETH, TON, and some tokens issued by group owners or event organizers themselves. The page will indicate asset units and exchange rate sources (if any).",
      "What is required for withdrawal? Withdrawals typically require you to provide a wallet address and basic security confirmation information. Normally, asset arrival time could be T+0 to T+2 working days; if the system detects high-risk behavior, withdrawal may be delayed.",
      "Who bears the transaction fees and gas?",
      "1. All on-chain transactions incur gas fees, which are network fees charged by the blockchain itself and not additional charges by moonpacket.",
      "2. When you deposit tokens into the red packet pool, gas fees will be deducted (or added) immediately on-chain, so the actual amount of tokens credited may be slightly less than the number you entered (or your on-chain record may include the gas fee).",
      "3. When you withdraw tokens from a red packet, your wallet needs to hold enough native assets (such as SOL, TRX, TON, BNB, depending on the chain supported by your red packet tokens) to pay for gas. If your wallet doesn't have enough assets to pay for gas, the withdrawal will fail. This means that the withdrawal itself also requires you to cover the gas fees.",
      "4. When sending red packets within 'your own group,' the platform will charge a 2% platform fee: 1% for platform operations, and 1% as a token reserve, which may be used to repurchase moonini tokens after reaching a specified threshold.",
      "5. If you are sending a 'cross-group red packet' (promoting by sending red packets to other groups): the system only allows mainstream tokens, may have a minimum amount threshold, and reserves about 3% as support or incentives for that target group's community, which will be claimed by that group's management or group owner. This means you can promote yourself by sending red packets in someone else's group (but only if that group owner agrees to the red packets and you need to comply with that group's rules), which is a great way to sponsor each other's community engagement.",
      "You can transfer your balance to friends or combine multiple balances, right? Currently, balance gifting or combining features are not available."
    ],
    "q5_title": "5) Risk control and restrictions",
    "q5_body": [
      "Why am I flagged as suspicious or intercepted? Common reasons include: the same user using multiple accounts in a short time, rapid repeat withdrawals, operating on multiple devices, unusual proxies/VPNs, mass grabbing of red packets in high-risk areas, or being listed in high-risk ASN/regions. These behaviors may be seen as abuse or fraud risk.",
      "How will the system handle this? In high-risk situations, the system may temporarily lock account functionalities (including withdrawals) and require further verification. You can report issues through the bot /report. Please note: this reporting channel is one-way; moonpacket reserves the right not to respond or disclose complete review details.",
      "Will KYC verification be required? In high-risk scenarios or due to compliance requirements, the system may ask you to complete KYC/AML verification (identity verification code, document verification, etc.). Please ensure you enter correct security information during the withdrawal process; if verification fails, you will not be able to complete the withdrawal of Tokens.",
      "What should I do if my account is restricted? Most restrictions are temporary protective measures. If you have completed the necessary verification and your situation was misjudged, we will restore your access under reasonable circumstances. If you have not completed security information verification, we will not proceed further."
    ],
    "q6_title": "6) Timeliness and notifications",
    "q6_body": [
      "When do red packet activities start or end? Each event organizer sets different timings, so please pay attention to the time, remaining quantity, and group announcements in the red packet messages. You can turn on Telegram notifications or set custom reminder tones to avoid missing out.",
      "Can I control notifications? Notifications like 'I received a red packet' and 'withdrawal completed' are usually determined by your Telegram notification settings; this is not set independently in moonpacket, but rather based on your personal notification preferences on Telegram."
    ],
    "q7_title": "7) Multilingual and regional differences",
    "q7_body": [
      "Why can't I see certain withdrawal methods or gameplay? Some regions may be subject to policy or compliance restrictions, causing the system to automatically hide inapplicable options or suspend participation in red packet activities for that region, indicating that withdrawals/participation are not supported at this time.",
      "How many decimal places does the digital format show? The system automatically applies thousand and decimal formatting based on your language settings, with a default max display of 8 decimal places. If the unit of a token is finer, we will round to the displayable range without showing infinitely long decimals."
    ],
    "q8_title": "8) Devices and Compatibility",
    "q8_body": [
      "Is Telegram available on iOS/Android/Desktop? Yes, it is recommended to use the latest version of Telegram. If you encounter loading issues, please ensure you are using the official client, or try refreshing (Reload Page) in the menu at the top right of the mini app page.",
      "Will changing devices affect withdrawal eligibility? Generally, it should not affect your history. However, if you repeatedly operate on multiple devices in a short time frame, the system may flag this as abnormal behavior and trigger risk control.",
      "Will using a VPN/proxy affect anything? High-risk or untrusted proxies/VPNs may be intercepted by the system. If issues occur, please try disabling the proxy or switch to a stable network environment and try again."
    ],
    "q9_title": "9) Privacy and Security",
    "q9_body": [
      "What data will be collected? We adhere to the principle of minimization and will only collect information necessary for fraud prevention, abuse protection, risk control, and compliance, such as account security checks, wallet addresses, Telegram ID, email, and other basic identifiers. If KYC / AML is involved, identity verification will be conducted by a trusted third-party verification service. moonpacket will not request any private information unrelated to the service. (moonpacket staff will only verify the security information you have provided, and will never ask about passwords, recovery phrases, verification codes, etc.)",
      "How is asset security protected? If the system detects suspected theft or high-risk behavior, we may activate automatic risk detection and, if necessary, refer it for manual review. To safeguard funds, we may delay or postpone withdrawals to prevent fraud and abuse, not to punish legitimate users.",
      "Can I delete my account or request data? You can submit a data access or deletion request following the process. We will handle it within the scope of legal regulations and investigation obligations. Please note: Even if you delete your account, we may still legally retain necessary transaction records and security audit records due to fraud prevention/compliance requirements; these records will not disappear immediately upon account deletion."
    ],
    "q10_title": "10) Support and Appeals",
    "q10_body": [
      "Who should I contact if I encounter a problem? You can message the official support bot @moonini_helper_bot. Once in the chat, please enter the command /setlang (for example, /setlang zh-TW or /setlang en-US) to switch support languages.",
      "When reporting a problem, please prepare: your Telegram account or wallet address, the occurrence time, the actions you were taking (like 'withdraw', 'send red packet', 'redeem red packet'), and any related transaction ID or hash (if available). The support team will assist based on on-chain records and transaction data.",
      "Very important: The official support will never message you first, will not ask you to transfer funds for verification, and will never request your private key, recovery phrase, full seed phrase, or any information that can directly control your wallet assets. Do not share this sensitive information with anyone.",
      "How long does it take to get a response regarding an appeal? Generally, we will respond within 1 to 3 business days. If the case involves frozen assets, security concerns, or large amounts, it will be prioritized. We may ask you for the transaction ID or hash to expedite confirmation."
    ],
    "q11_title": "11) Other Games and Information",
    "q11_body": [
      "Can I participate in activities from other groups? Yes. Different communities or groups may hold their own red packet activities or promotions. Please pay attention to the announcements for each activity, as eligibility, limits, and deadlines may vary.",
      "Is there a leaderboard or reward mechanism? Some events will display leaderboards, interactive statistics, prize lists, or lottery results. Please refer to the announcements of each event for the actual reward conditions, thresholds, and distribution methods. The organizer reserves the right to final interpretation and adjustments."

    "a11": "There may be synchronization delays between different APIs in Telegram, so please wait if you cannot pass temporarily. If you cannot pass verification for an extended period, there may be an issue with the API provider; please contact the project that issued the red packet task.",
    "a12": "The passphrase is usually announced by the organizer in related posts, live streams, or videos; you can retry if you enter it incorrectly, but multiple incorrect attempts may trigger rate limiting.",
    "a13": "moonpacket provides an API for external projects to verify whether users have completed tasks. When users claim the red packet, they will query the API and return the verification result, which will only unlock if the conditions are met. If no response is returned, you can wait and re-trigger it later.",

    "a18": "Transfer/gifting or merging is not supported.",
    "a19": "Possible reasons include multiple accounts from the same device, abnormal proxies/VPNs, excessively high frequencies of claiming red packets in multiple groups, blacklisted regions/ASN, etc. You can send /report message content to the bot; this is a one-way reply channel, and the official reserves the right not to explain reasons or respond to account suspension.",
    "a2": "Simply be in supported groups and ensure the bot has joined the group (with Admin permissions granted).",
    "a20": "In high-risk situations, verification will be based on the information provided by the user. Please ensure you fill in the correct security information when withdrawing; if the information is incorrect, you will not pass the biometric and document KYC.",
    "a21": "Restrictions are usually temporary protective measures. If you need assistance, please send /report message content. Issues raised by verifiers who have not completed the security information will not be processed; if verification is completed and the situation is normal, we will handle it.",
    "a22": "Each project that issues red packets is different; please pay attention to the timing and remaining quotas of the red packet information. You can enable Telegram notifications or set special notification sounds to easily receive reminders for claiming red packets.",
    "a23": "This is your setting in Telegram, not in moonpacket. You can adjust notification settings in Telegram's settings.",
    "a24": "Policies in certain regions may not apply, and the system will automatically hide or make withdrawals impossible, meaning you cannot participate in the red packet game; this region is not currently supported.",
    "a25": "The system will automatically apply localized delimiters and decimal places based on your language; we display up to 8 decimal places, and if your token value exceeds the display range, it will be handled accordingly.",
    "a26": "Yes, it is recommended to use the latest version of Telegram. If you encounter issues with unreadable content, please ensure you are using the official client, or update the application or click Reload Page in the upper right corner of the mini app page.",
    "a27": "Will not affect the record, but repeated operations on multiple devices in a short time may trigger risk control.",
    "a28": "If you are using a high-risk proxy, it may be intercepted. We recommend disabling the proxy temporarily or switching to a clean network environment and trying again.",
    "a29": "Follow the principle of minimization: only collect necessary data for distribution, withdrawal, and risk control (e.g., personal security questions, wallet address, email, Telegram ID). For necessary identity verification, we will use a third-party verification platform, and the platform will not store any user privacy data except for security information.",
    "a3": "When you see a red packet message in the group, click the 'Claim' button to receive it.",
    "a30": "All key operations require two-factor authentication; high-risk withdrawals may trigger manual review.",
    "a31": "You can submit data access or deletion requests according to the process. Once the account is deleted, you will no longer be able to log in, but transaction data will be retained under compliance requirements.",
    "a32": "You can contact us by submitting/reporting information content in the bot; providing an error code and a screenshot can expedite processing.",
    "a33": "Generally, you will receive a reply within 1-3 business days; urgent fund-related cases will be prioritized.",
    "a34": "Yes, all activity rules are independent, so please pay attention to each activity's limits and validity period.",

Due to cross-platform reasons, updates may be delayed; if you cannot claim after clicking again, we recommend refreshing the page to confirm the latest status of the red packet activity.",
    "a9": "Common reasons: claimed out or tasks not completed. In rare cases, it may be suspended or terminated due to the project's risk.
