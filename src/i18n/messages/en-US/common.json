    "title": "About Receiving Red Packet",
    "faq": {
      "a1": "Use the link to activate our bot for automatic experience registration. moonpacket allows group owners to mount in their groups. Players can grab red packets not only in our official group but also in all groups bound to the moonpacket red packet bot.",
      "a10": "You must complete specified conditions (such as following the channel, joining the group, passing the password, external tasks) to claim. After completing, return to the red packet information post's button to 'claim red packet'.",
      "a11": "There might be synchronization delays between different API on Telegram; if not passed immediately, please wait a moment. If you continue to fail to pass, it is likely an issue with the API provider, and we recommend reporting it to the project that issued the red packet task.",
      "a12": "The password is usually announced by the project in posts, live broadcasts, or videos on x; you may retry if entered incorrectly, but multiple incorrect attempts may trigger rate limiting.",
      "a13": "moonpacket provides API for external projects to confirm whether users have completed tasks. When users claim red packets, a request is sent to the API which returns the verification result; if it meets the conditions, it's unlocked; if it hasn't returned yet, you can wait and restart later.",
      "a14": "Successful claims will be pushed through the Telegram bot and a red packet claim record will be available in the mini app, allowing you to view history and available withdrawable balance at any time.",
      "a15": "Based on the activity settings, red packets are currently divided into main USDT/SOL/ETH/TON and the tokens issued by the group owner. The page will indicate the asset units and exchange rates (if any).",
      "a16": "You need to provide your wallet address and basic identity information for security purposes; the arrival time is usually T+0 to T+2 working days. It may be extended during abnormal risk control.",
      "a17": "Each on-chain operation requires a gas fee, which is charged by the blockchain itself, and moonpacket does not charge extra.",
      "a18": "No method of 'transferring/merging' is provided.",
      "a19": "Possible reasons include multiple accounts on the same device, abnormal proxies/VPNs, too high frequency of grabbing red packets in multiple groups, blacklist regions/ASN, etc. You can send the /report message content to the bot; this is a one-way reply channel, and the official reserves the right to not explain or respond regarding account bans.",
      "a2": "No installation of additional applications is required; it is recommended to use the latest version of Telegram. If you open the WebApp in the system browser, please ensure that cookies/storage are not blocked.",
      "a20": "In high-risk situations, verification will be based on the information provided by users; please ensure that correct security information is filled in when withdrawing; if incorrect information is not provided, you will not pass biometric and document KYC.",
      "a21": "Restrictions are usually temporary protective measures. Please send the /report message content to the bot. Questions raised by verifiers who have not completed filling out security information will not be processed; if the situation is normal after verification completion, we will handle it.",
      "a22": "Each project issuing red packets has different conditions, please pay attention to the time and remaining quotas of the red packet information; you can enable Telegram notifications or set specific notification sounds to receive timely alerts for grabbing red packets.",
      "a23": "This is your setting on Telegram, not a moonpacket setting; you can adjust notifications in your Telegram settings.",
      "a24": "Policies in certain regions are not applicable, and the system will automatically hide or prevent withdrawals, indicating that you cannot participate in the red packet grabbing activity, as this region currently does not support it.",
      "a25": "The website will automatically apply localized thousand separators and decimal places based on your language.",
      "a26": "Yes, it is recommended to use the latest version of Telegram. If you encounter unreadable situations, please check if you are using the official client, or update the app, or click to reload the page in the three dots at the top right corner of the mini app page.",
      "a27": "It will not affect records, but if repeated operations are performed on multiple devices in a short time, it may trigger risk control.",
      "a28": "If you are using a high-risk proxy, it may be intercepted. We recommend temporarily disabling the proxy or switching to a clean network environment and trying again.",
      "a29": "Follow the principle of minimization: only collect data necessary for distribution/withdrawal/risk control (such as personal security questions, wallet addresses, email, Telegram ID). When necessary authentication is required, we will verify through a third-party verification platform, which does not store user's private data except for security information.",
      "a3": "Generally, all Telegram users are eligible to participate; however, each group's API design is different, and you must comply with the regulations of that group or channel. Certain regions may have internet restrictions, or some events may set regional/age limits, and the system will automatically determine ineligible participants and prevent them from claiming.",
      "a30": "All critical operations will require a second verification; high-risk withdrawals may trigger manual review.",
      "a31": "You can submit a data access or deletion request according to the process. Once the account is deleted, you will no longer be able to log in, but transaction data will be retained under compliance requirements.",
      "a32": "You can contact us by submitting/reporting information through the bot. Providing error codes and screenshots can expedite processing.",
      "a33": "Generally, responses are provided within 1-3 business days; urgent fund-related cases will be prioritized.",
      "a34": "Yes; each activity has independent rules, please pay attention to the limits and validity period of each event.",
      "a35": "Some activities may have leaderboards/badges and lotteries; refer to the activity page for rules and rewards.",
      "a4": "No. The system will prevent users from claiming repeatedly by using the Telegram account + bound Gmail, verification code, unique wallet address, and abnormal scans in the background; violations may trigger risk control and lead to account suspension.",
      "a5": "Group or channel project activities can choose 'random', 'even distribution', or 'designated'. Each group's rules are different, please refer to the markings in the activity description information of each group.",
      "a6": "moonpacket only provides red packets; the red packet system acts as an auxiliary bot tool, with no investment or business affiliation with operators of various platforms. Therefore, ensuring absolute fairness in distribution is the only way to meet everyone's needs. Additionally, there is an audit record retained on the server side for a certain period (algorithm and seed); users can check their claim results on the bot after the red packet claiming activity ends, and this result can also be queried after launching the Telegram miniapp.",
      "a7": "Depends on the event settings designed by the project party. Some are one-time, while others have daily limits, and if there is a 'multiple times per person' limit, the system will also automatically restrict it and prompt when the limit is reached.",
      "a8": "If the shares are claimed out or expired, it will end; or if the organizer suspends or terminates due to abnormal risks, the red packet page will be synchronized in real time.",
      "a9": "Common reasons: claimed out/task not completed. In a few cases, projects may be paused or terminated due to risks. Due to the time lag in information updates between groups, it may not be reflected immediately; please pay attention to the latest status of red packet information on the event page posted by the group.",

    "faq": {
      "a1": "Please add the moonpacket bot to your Telegram group or channel and set it as an administrator. Make sure to enable at least: post, edit/delete own posts permissions. After completing, return to the moonpacket 'Send Red Packet' page, and you will see the bound groups/channels in the 'Send To' list.",
      "a10": "Yes. moonpacket will call the read-only API you provided for verification before users claim. The backend only needs to set api_url and api_key (domain permission can be optionally configured).",
      "a11": "Mainstream coins (USDT/TON, etc.) will be displayed in the group and also in the homepage feed for higher exposure; meme coins will only be displayed in your group.",
      "a12": "Including behavior frequency and device/IP detection, unique binding of accounts and wallets, withdrawal verification code, AI risk control initial review; if necessary, there will be third-party biometric + facial + identification verification.",
      "a13": "Please check 'Red Packets I Sent' on your personal homepage to see the number of claimants, remaining shares, and total amount consumed for each session; if enabled, you can also download reports.",
      "a2": "Please deposit the assets you want to issue first (for example, deposit 10 USDT for testing). You can send mainstream tokens (USDT/TON, etc.) or your own meme coins. Mainstream tokens will appear additionally in the homepage feed, while meme coins are only displayed within your community.",
      "a3": "In 'Send Targets', check the bound groups/channels to send to single or multiple groups at the same time. If you do not see them in the list, please confirm that the bot is an administrator of the group/channel and has the necessary permissions.",
      "a4": "You can choose random (luck) or fixed amount (equal distribution). Both can set the total amount, number of shares, and per person cap, and can add validity period or scheduled release.",
      "a5": "Yes. You can set a one-time full release or batch release within a specified period; countdown and preview messages are also supported.",
      "a6": "The system is based on your available balance. If the balance is insufficient, a failure prompt will be sent requesting you to top up to avoid overspending.",
      "a7": "Distribution is executed on the server side and retains audit records (algorithm and seed, operation logs). Rules, shares, limits, and final results will be publicly displayed on the event page for traceability.",
      "a8": "Yes. You can enable the built-in condition 'Must join certain group/follow certain channel'. The premise is that your bot is in that group/channel and has permissions to post and edit/delete own posts to verify member status.",
      "a9": "Players need to obtain the password through external channels and can claim it after correctly entering it on the page. Common practices include: splitting the 6-digit password in long YouTube videos to encourage full viewing; hinting at the password in X.com (Twitter) posts or Threads to enhance interaction; only verbally announcing the password during livestreams to guide attendees; dedicated passwords in private/paid groups to ensure benefits are only given to core members.",
