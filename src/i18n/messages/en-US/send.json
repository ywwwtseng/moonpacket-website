    "q1_title": "1) What is the red packet feature of moonpacket?",
    "q1_body": [
      "This is a tool to help project teams, group owners, or community managers quickly distribute red packets in Telegram groups.\nSpecifically targeting meme coin distribution to incentivize community members,\nmain uses include: stimulate activity, attract new members, and carry out promotional activities.\nYou can use not only your issued meme coins to distribute red packets but also mainstream tokens like USDT, TRX, SOL, and others.\nThrough moonpacket, you can require users to complete simple tasks, and further configure through the API, allowing group owners to 'customize distribution rules' and 'set claim conditions', verifying with their own API.",
      "Tip: Distributing moonpacket red packets allows you to discover truly valuable community members. You can set claim conditions in each red packet, providing players with different tasks to complete."
    ],
    "q2_title": "2) When is it appropriate to use the red packet feature?",
    "q2_body": [
      "Welcome message for new members after joining (meeting basic joining tasks)",
      "Real-time interaction during live broadcasts / AMAs / events (only members focused on the event can receive the passphrase and qualify for the red packet)",
      "In-group marketing promotions, lotteries, slogan tasks, game leveling, recharge rebates (e.g., only players who reach a certain level in the game or recharge a certain amount are eligible to receive)",
      "Rewards for inviting friends to join the group",
      "Limited-time promotions, countdown events (daily sign-in tasks)",
      "\"Cross-group red packet\": Drop red packets in other groups (if the group owner allows), to promote mutual publicity and community collaboration."
    ],
    "q3_title": "3) Cost and threshold for sending red packets",
    "q3_body": [
      "All on-chain operations incur a gas fee. The gas fee is charged by the blockchain itself and not an additional fee from us.",
      "When you deposit tokens into the red packet pool, a gas fee will be deducted on-chain immediately. The actual amount entering the pool may be slightly less than the nominal amount you entered (or an additional gas fee may be charged upon transfer). This is normal on-chain deduction.",
      "When issuing a red packet in 'your group', the system will automatically charge a 2% platform fee at the time of distribution, which will be deducted directly.",
      "Cross-group red packets (promoting a red packet in someone else's group) have additional rules:",
      "First, the group owner receiving the promotion must set permission, and mainstream tokens must be used. Cross-group red packets do not accept self-created meme coins, and the system has a minimum threshold for cross-group red packet amounts. If below the threshold, the red packet cannot be established. Please confirm that your amount is sufficient before sending."
    ],
    "q4_title": "4) Security, Risk Control, and Account Status",
    "q4_body": [
      "We will actively detect abusive behaviors (such as fraud, money laundering, robot tactics, spam interactions, etc.). If deemed high risk, the account or assets may enter 'under review' status: withdrawals may be delayed, and the account may be temporarily blacklisted. This is to protect overall user assets and comply with regulatory requirements.",
      "This is the platform's risk control and compliance mechanism. Based on internal risk control, compliance requirements, or third-party investigations, we may suspend, restrict, delay, or deny specific withdrawals or transfers.",
      "If you believe this is a misjudgment, you can submit an appeal through the official customer service bot."
    ],
    "q5_title": "5) Customer service and self-service query",
    "q5_body": [
      "You can message the official customer service bot directly @moonini_helper_bot.",
      "Please enter the command /setlang in the conversation (e.g., /setlang zh-TW or /setlang en-US) to switch the customer service language.",
      "When reporting an issue, please provide:",
      "Customer service will only check on-chain data and transaction records. We will not ask you to send image originals or provide wallet private keys, mnemonics, or complete seed phrases, nor will we ask you to remit funds for 'verification'. Official customer service will not proactively message you to request assets.",
      "You can also use the self-service query API to check your status, such as whether your account is valid, if it is blacklisted, or if it is under review. Here is an example: if the response shows you are is_blacklist: true or status: \"hold\", it means the account is under risk control review, and withdrawals or distributions may be suspended. If this function is unavailable during the test operation period, please submit an appeal through the customer service bot and provide the transaction hash, and we will expedite processing based on on-chain evidence."
    ],
    "q6_title": "6) Activity rules, eligibility control, and no mid-course rule changes",
    "q6_body": [
      "We provide an API mechanism for group owners to customize task conditions and redemption rules.",
      "What is a passphrase? When should it be used? For example, when you want to ask more users to visit your TikTok or YouTube, or join your private group, you can hide the passphrase in videos or messages. Users need to obtain the passphrase at the specified location to claim the red packet after entering it.",
      "What is the concept of API? How is eligibility determined?",
      "In the API settings interface, we first need to inform the API of the conditions, referred to as 'condition declaration' (excluding user_id).\nExample: Return a set of threshold conditions, such as level, status, whether on the blacklist, etc.\nmoonpacket will regard this set of conditions as the basic threshold.",
      "Next, when the user wants to receive a red packet, the API needs to provide:\n'User Query' (including user_id).\nExample: Return the actual value of that user. The platform will compare the results of 'User Query' with the previously set 'condition declaration' threshold; if it matches, it is approved; if not, it is rejected.",
      "Safety Recommendation: Please only provide read-only endpoints and enable api_key along with domain whitelisting restrictions; if cross-domain operations are needed, you can use Cloudflare Workers as a relay and implement rate limiting.",
      "Can the activity rules be modified midway?",
      "No modifications can be made midway. We hope all users of this system can mutually maintain trust. If a project party promises to issue red packets but changes the game qualifications midway, making it impossible to claim, this will damage players' trust. If the issuer modifies the API to change rules, and multiple players report it, we will retain the right to suspend or freeze accounts upon confirming through change logs. Therefore, please absolutely avoid changing game rules mid-API, as it may lead to account bans.",
      "If you are worried about incorrect settings, the correct approach is:",
      "You can first create your own test group, issue test red packets to yourself in the test group, and once confirmed without issues, proceed to distribute in the official community. The basic rule for red packets is: you cannot call for a stop midway, nor can you directly change rules for an ongoing activity. Each round must be completed and settled according to the original commitment before new rules can be used in the next round."

    "q7_title": "7) Track performance, optimize and prevent fraud",
    "q7_body": [
      "We are currently still in the Beta operation phase and will gradually optimize the data dashboard, including the number of participants, number of red packets claimed, claiming rate, etc. Project parties can also embed tracking indicators in their API settings.",
      "Unclaimed red packets will automatically be returned to your wallet. If you do not receive a refund within 3 days after the activity ends, you may inquire with customer service for processing.",
      "It's advisable not to execute too many activities simultaneously in the same group to avoid conflicts. Users may also get confused; it's best to execute activities linearly, one at a time or one per day, and ensure adequate funds to complete each activity.",
      "It is recommended to adjust the rules based on data; you can utilize the API for A/B testing, reference past successful cases, and regularly collect member feedback to gradually optimize gameplay.",
      "Anti-cheating and abuse:",
      "During the open beta operation testing period, we are optimizing user cheating issues. To ensure the fairness of the system, we will specifically block users attempting to use bots to grab red packets. The best prevention method is to allow users to set their own API and conditions and restrict the number of claims, which will raise the threshold for those who like to cheat. In case of abnormal situations, please feel free to contact our customer service for feedback."
